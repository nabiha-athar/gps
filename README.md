# GPS -- Route Finder

Implemented a program to find the shortest route between cities using an adjacency list. 

Language: Python
Algorithm: Breadth First Search (BFS)

The data and code within the 'if __name__ == __main__' are used to construct the adjacency list. The BFS algorithm is used to determine the shortest path between a starting city and destination city.
